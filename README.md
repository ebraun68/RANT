Reconciliation of Avian NCBI Taxonomy

This repository includes programs used to reconcile the avian taxonomy used by NCBI with the eBird taxonomy. It is intended to serve the avian biodiversity research community, providing a means to link genetic sequence data available from NCBI with a standardized taxonomy. Full description of the reconciliation and analysis of the taxonomic distribution of sequence data is available here:
